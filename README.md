# H-Console

An improved Console for Windows OS, with many personalized functions and better quality

It works like a Console but with several legal and useful commands

# REMINDER

I am not responsible for unethical user usage, I am making it available for educational and helping purposes

# About of the versions

It is still in testing, all vT versions (test versions) are still unstable versions that may present some problems,
I recommend that you only use vR versions (released versions)
